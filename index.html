          <li>“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept.” </li>
          <li>“I think people should be allowed to do anything they want. We haven’t tried that for a while. Maybe this
            time it’ll work.”</li>
          <li>“Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity.”</li>
          <li>“It’s never just a game when you’re winning.”</li>
          <li>“Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.”</li>
          <li>“If it’s true that our species is alone in the universe, then I’d have to say that the universe aimed
            rather low and settled for very little.”</li>
          <li>“The planet is fine. The people are fucked.”</li>
          <li>“The main reason Santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live.”</li>
          <li>“Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you
            is a maniac?” </li>
          <li>“Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches
            everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he
            does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and
            smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and
            scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!<br><br>

            But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect,
            all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money!”</li>
